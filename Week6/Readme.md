## Keys in React

1. Keys are used to iterate over an array using map which help react to know which array element has to be interated by giving them each element of the array a proper id. 


## Wrapper Components


## Hooks
1. Hooks in React allow us to "hook into" React State and Lifecycle features from function components.

### LifeCycle Feature
1. When we use Class Based Components, we got access to Lifecycle functions. 
    There are 4 Lifecycle Methods in Class Based Components. 
    1. componentDidMount()
    2. componentDidUpdate()
    3. componentWillUnmount()
    4. shouldComponentUpdate()

-- UseEffect is the first hook that let us do a lifecycle Event.
